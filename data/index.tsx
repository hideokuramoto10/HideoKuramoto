    excerpt:
      "How I architected a production AI SaaS platform with Next.js and OpenAI APIs — covering multi-model routing, streaming responses, auth, and deployment on Vercel.",
    content: `MatrixAI started as an experiment: what would a truly production-grade AI SaaS look like when built lean?\n\n**Multi-Model Architecture**\nRather than hardcoding GPT-4, I built a model router that selects the best model per request based on complexity, cost, and latency targets. Simple queries hit GPT-3.5-turbo; complex reasoning goes to GPT-4o. This cut costs by ~35% with no quality loss.\n\n**Streaming with Next.js App Router**\nNext.js 14's App Router + React Server Components made streaming trivial. I use the Vercel AI SDK's useChat hook on the client, with a route handler that pipes OpenAI's streaming response directly to the browser.\n\n**Auth & Multi-Tenancy**\nClerk handles auth — it's the fastest way to get social login, session management, and org-level multi-tenancy running without rolling your own. Each org gets isolated usage quotas tracked in Postgres.\n\n**Deployment**\nVercel + Postgres (Neon serverless) + Edge Functions for the streaming endpoints. Cold starts are under 200ms thanks to Edge runtime. Total infra cost for early users: under $20/month.`,

    content: `MindForge solves the problem every developer faces: too much information, not enough structure. Here is how I built the AI layer.\n\n**Semantic Search over Notes**\nEvery note is embedded with text-embedding-3-small at save time and stored in Pinecone. When you search, the query is embedded and the top-k semantically similar notes are returned — far better than keyword matching.\n\n**Auto-Summarisation Pipeline**\nLong notes are chunked and summarised on a background queue (Bull + Redis). Summaries are cached and re-generated only when the source note changes. This keeps the UI instant while the LLM work happens asynchronously.\n\n**Content Generation Workflows**\nUsers can trigger generation jobs: expand a bullet list into a full doc, generate a presentation outline from notes, or draft an email from a meeting summary. Each workflow is a LangChain chain with a structured output parser.\n\n**Scaling the Backend**\nNode.js + Fastify (not Express — Fastify is ~30% faster for JSON serialisation). PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching and queues. Everything containerised with Docker and deployed on Railway.`,

Updated nightly via a cron job — no real-time inference needed, which keeps costs near zero.\n\n**Semantic Product Search**\nInstead of SQL LIKE queries, search uses a hybrid approach: BM25 keyword matching combined with vector similarity re-ranking. Users find what they mean, not just what they typed.\n\n**Dynamic UI with AI**\nThe hero banner and featured products sections are populated by a lightweight recommendation model that considers time-of-day, device type, and browsing history. A/B tested against static content — 18% higher click-through.\n\n**Tech Stack**\nNext.js 14 App Router for the frontend, a serverless FastAPI layer for AI inference, and Shopify as the commerce backend via GraphQL Storefront API.

    content: `Document Chat lets users upload any PDF, Word doc, or text file and chat with it using natural language. Here is how the pipeline works end to end.\n\n**Document Ingestion**\nFiles are uploaded to S3, then processed by a FastAPI background task. I use LangChain's document loaders for format handling, then recursive character splitting with 512-token chunks and 64-token overlap.\n\n**Embedding & Storage**\nChunks are embedded with OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small and upserted to Pinecone with document metadata (filename, page number, chunk index). Namespace per user keeps data isolated.\n\n**Retrieval & Reranking**\nOn each query, I retrieve top-20 chunks by cosine similarity, then rerank with Cohere's rerank-english-v2.0 model to get the top-5. The reranker consistently outperforms pure vector similarity by a meaningful margin on precision.\n\n**Chat Interface**\nNext.js + Vercel AI SDK on the frontend.

    content: `ACE AI combines four AI features that students actually need: document chat, quiz generation, note summarisation, and live web search. Here is how I built each one.\n\n**Document Chat with Pinecone**\nSame RAG pipeline as Document Chat (see previous post) but scoped to study materials. Each user's uploaded notes are namespaced in Pinecone so queries only search their own documents.\n\n**Quiz Generation**\nGiven a topic or uploaded doc, GPT-4o generates multiple-choice questions with distractors and explanations. I use structured output (JSON mode) and validate with Pydantic before returning to the client — no more hallucinated answer formats.\n\n**Web Search Agent**\nFor questions beyond the uploaded docs, a LangChain agent with a Tavily Search tool fetches current information. The agent decides whether to use search based on the query — it doesn't blindly call the web for every question.\n\n**Vercel AI SDK Integration**\nThe Next.js frontend uses useChat for the streaming chat UI and useCompletion for one-shot generation features (quiz, summary). Both connect to the same FastAPI backend via separate endpoints.`,

    content: `Video2Text lets users submit any video URL or upload a file and receive an accurate transcript within minutes. The engineering is straightforward but the edge cases are brutal.\n\n**Whisper for Transcription**\nOpenAI's Whisper large-v3 model is the quality bar to beat for transcription. I run it via the openai-whisper Python package on a CPU instance — GPU would be faster but the cost doesn't justify it for batch workloads.\n\n**Async Processing with FastAPI**\nLong videos can take minutes to process. The API accepts the job and returns a task ID immediately. A Celery worker picks up the job, processes it, and stores the result in Redis. The client polls the task status endpoint until completion.\n\n**Audio Extraction**\nffmpeg extracts audio from video before passing to Whisper. I chunk long audio into 30-minute segments to avoid memory issues on the worker. Segments are transcribed in parallel when multiple workers are available.\n\n**Timestamp & Speaker Info**\nWhisper's word-level timestamps are enabled for precise subtitle generation. For speaker diarisation (who said what), I integrate pyannote.audio as a post-processing step — it assigns speaker labels to each Whisper segment.`,

      "What I learned building a full wedding website — from RSVP flow design and photo gallery performance to guest-facing UX and mobile-first layout decisions.",
    content: `Building a wedding website sounds simple. It isn't — guests range from 18 to 80, many on mobile, some on slow connections, all with zero tolerance for confusion.\n\n**RSVP Form UX**\nThe RSVP form went through four iterations. Key insight: multi-step forms with a progress indicator outperformed single-page forms for completion rate. Guests knew exactly how much was left.\n\n**Photo Gallery Performance**\nOriginal implementation loaded full-res images — page weight hit 40MB. Solution: sharp for server-side image resizing to multiple breakpoints, lazy loading with IntersectionObserver, and WebP with JPEG fallback. Page weight dropped to 3MB.\n\n**Mobile-First Everything**\nOver 70% of RSVP submissions came from mobile. I rebuilt the layout mobile-first with CSS Grid, ensuring tap targets were minimum 44×44px and form inputs didn't trigger unwanted zoom on iOS.\n\n**Animation Without Jank**\nUsed Framer Motion for entrance animations but wrapped every animation in a will-change: transform to keep compositing on the GPU. No layout thrash, smooth 60fps on mid-range Android devices.`,

    content: `Building e-commerce from scratch teaches you exactly why Shopify exists. But doing it yourself gives you full control and a deep understanding of the moving parts.\n\n**Cart State Management**\nI used Zustand for cart state — simpler than Redux for this use case, with built-in persistence via zustand/middleware. The cart syncs to localStorage so it survives page refreshes.\n\n**Stripe Integration**\nStripe Checkout handles the payment page — no PCI scope, battle-tested UX. I use Stripe webhooks to update order status server-side. The webhook handler verifies the signature before processing to prevent spoofed events.\n\n**Order Management**\nOrders are stored in MongoDB with status transitions (pending → paid → shipped → delivered). An admin dashboard built with React Query and a simple Express API lets me manage inventory and update order statuses.\n\n**Performance**\nNext.js ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for product pages — they rebuild in the background when inventory changes, serving static HTML to users. Product pages load in under 500ms on a 4G connection.`,

    content: `Weflix is a front-end engineering challenge disguised as a fun project. Here is what made it non-trivial.\n\n**API Integration Strategy**\nThe TMDB API returns paginated results with variable response shapes. I wrote a typed API client with Zod validation — if the API returns unexpected data, the app fails gracefully instead of crashing.\n\n**Real-Time Search**\nSearch is debounced at 300ms with useCallback. Results are cached in a Map keyed by query string — repeat searches are instant. I cancel in-flight requests with AbortController when a new query comes in before the previous one resolves.\n\n**Virtualized Lists**\nWith thousands of titles, rendering every card causes noticeable jank. React Window virtualises the grid — only visible cards are in the DOM. Scroll performance stays at 60fps even on long genre lists.\n\n**Trailer Modals**\nYouTube embeds inside a React Portal with a focus trap for accessibility. The modal preloads the iframe src only when opened — not on page load — so it doesn't affect initial LCP.`,

A custom Django middleware injects the tenant into every ORM query via a thread-local, so no query can accidentally leak data across tenants. PostgreSQL row-level security adds a database-level enforcement layer.\n\n**Django REST Framework Structure**\nViewSets with tenant-scoped querysets, serializers with nested relations, and custom permissions that check both authentication and tenant membership. API versioning via URL prefix (v1, v2) from day one.\n\n**Real-Time with Redis and Channels**\nProject status updates and notifications use Django Channels over WebSocket. Redis as the channel layer — all worker processes share the same pub/sub bus, so notifications reach users regardless of which dyno handles their WebSocket.\n\n**React Redux State**\nRedux Toolkit with RTK Query for API fetching.

    content: `Dress Atelier specialises in imported European wedding dresses. The website needed to communicate exclusivity and warmth simultaneously.\n\n**Gallery Architecture**\nThe dress gallery uses a masonry grid with hover overlays showing dress name and collection. Filtering by silhouette, neckline, and colour lets brides narrow choices intuitively.\n\n**Plan Pages**\nThree clear service tiers — Rental, Ceremony, Photo — each have dedicated landing pages with pricing, inclusions, and gallery. CTAs lead to a single unified inquiry form.\n\n**Trust Signals**\nBlog posts documenting real shoot locations (snow, overseas, studio) act as social proof and fuel organic search traffic for location-specific queries.`,

    content: `Flower is a women's fashion brand with a strong seasonal identity. The web shop needed to match that identity while driving sales.\n\n**Shopify Theme Architecture**\nI built a custom Liquid theme from scratch rather than adapting an existing one. This gave full control over component structure, load order, and brand-specific interactions.\n\n**Lookbook Integration**\nSeasonal lookbook pages are built as editorial spreads. Each look links directly to the product page for every item worn — a key conversion driver.\n\n**Cart and Checkout UX**\nA slide-out cart with real-time stock indicators and a streamlined checkout reduced drop-off. Upsell suggestions in the cart are based on the current season's curated pairings.`,

These pages are built reusably so the marketing team can spin up a new one in minutes.\n\n**Coordination Content**\nA makeup coordination section shows complete looks using multiple Ririmew products. Each look lists every product used with direct add-to-cart links — measurably increasing basket size.\n\n**Performance on Shopify**\nBy deferring non-critical scripts and using Shopify's native image optimisation pipeline, the storefront achieves a 90+ Lighthouse performance score despite heavy imagery.`,

    content: `Gelato Pique is known for soft, pastel loungewear. The website had to feel as gentle and considered as the products.\n\n**Minimal Design System**\nA tight design system — two typefaces, a muted pastel palette, 8px grid — ensures every page feels cohesive. No component deviates from the system without reason.\n\n**Seasonal Campaign Pages**\nCampaign pages are rebuilt each season. I created a template system in Liquid so the in-house team can update seasonal content without touching code.\n\n**International Considerations**\nThe site serves both domestic and international customers. Locale detection switches language and currency automatically, and the checkout adapts to the selected region.`,

All animations are disabled via prefers-reduced-motion.\n\n**Performance**\nLazy video loading and adaptive image sizing keep the site fast even on mobile, despite hosting extensive photography and video content.`,
